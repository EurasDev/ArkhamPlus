Installation instructions:

1. Make sure Minecraft Forge is already installed.
2. Locate your Minecraft application folder. 
   Windows: Run > %appdata% > .minecraft
   Mac: Finder > Hold "Alt" & click > Library > Application Support > Minecraft
3. Place the Arkham+ mod (arkhamplus-1.1.jar) into the Mods folder.
4. When you launch Minecraft, the mod should be successfully installed.

NOTE: This mod may not be compatible with other installed mods. 
Arkham+ overrides the Minecraft main menu buttons, and so there will be issues with other mods that do this also.
